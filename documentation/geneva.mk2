_Geneva_ is the portable document preparation system. It follows the
principle _Write once, read anywhere_. The system isolates document
content and structure from document presentation and thereby enables the
creation and archival of highly portable documents.

_Geneva_ achieves this by employing a generic but well defined document
structure in conjunction with a diverse toolchain composed of input
interfaces and presentation backends. In addition to classic document
features such as paragraphs, listings, sections, tables and text markup,
_Geneva_ defines a generic media type designed to be used to embed
arbitrary figures and enable extensibility in a plug-in oriented way.

The input interfaces, such as the plain text oriented {mk2} markup
language and the Geneva API, are user and programmer facing frontends to
document authoring. The presentation backends render documents to several
targets including web, print and plain text media.
