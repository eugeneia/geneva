A _Geneva document_ is an ordered collection of _elements_. Geneva
defines the following _element types_:

 + Pargraph
 + Listing
 + Table
 + Plaintext
 + Media


< Rich text

 A central component of all element types is _rich text_. Rich text is
 defined as a sequence of _text tokens_, each made up of a character
 string and an attribute to signify its appearance. There are five
 different types of text tokens:

 #table Text token types.#
 | Name   | Description
 | plain  | Render sequence in regular font.
 | bold   | Recommends to render sequence in bold font.
 | italic | Recommends to render sequence in italic font.
 | code   | Recommends to render sequence in fixed-width font.
 | uri    | Interpret sequence as _Uniform Resource Identifier_.

 The occurrance of _whitespace characters_ text tokens is restricted by
 the following rules:

  + Whitespace character sequences of length two or more are to be
    reduced to a single _space character_ ({ASCII 0x20} or equivalent).
  + For all token types except the plain type, discard prefixes and
    suffixes of whitespace character sequences.
  + For the first and last text tokens in a rich text sequence, discard
    prefixes and suffixes of whitespace character sequences respectively.

 At least the following conceptual characters have to be recognized as
 whitespace:

 + Space
 + Tab
 + Newline (including Carriage Return)
 + Vertical Tab
 + Page break

< Element types

 A *paragraph* consists of exactly one rich text sequence. It signifies a
 self-contained piece of text.

 A *listing* consists of a finite sequence of rich text sequences. It
 signifies an ordered group of self-contained text pieces.

 A *table* consists of a two-dimensional matrix of rich text sequences
 and a single rich text sequence being its description. It signifies a
 tabular relation of the matrix of rich text pieces.

 A *plaintext* element consists of a verbatim character string and a
 single rich text sequence being its description. It signifies a sequence
 of characters which has to be left unchanged except for whitespace
 prefixes and suffixes (including newlines).

 A *media* element consists of an Unique Resource Identifier and a single
 rich text sequence being its description. It signifies the embedment of
 an external resource.

 A description as mentioned above, is a piece of text elaborating the
 contents of a given element.

 A *section* consists of a Geneva document and a single rich text
 sequence being its heading. It signifies a continuous subsequence of the
 document, introduced by a headline (the heading).
